# Twitch Chat Prediction Buttons - Elgato Streamdeck Plugin

This is a plugin for the Elgato Streamdeck enabling users to setup repeatable predictions and control them at their finger tips.

## How it works

Using TwitchCodeGenerator, users add an access code from the generator and can then setup predictions etc. When a prediction is initiated, the user is directed to a subview where they can directly control a prediction.

## Updating the beta app

When you want to update this plugin while in this beta phase, you will need to remove it from your plugin list, but has to be done from the Elgato/plugins folder in **C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins** or for Mac Users **~/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/**. Just delete the *io.predictionbuttons.sdPlugin* and restart the app before updating.
