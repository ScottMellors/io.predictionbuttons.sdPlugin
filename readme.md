# Twitch Chat Prediction Buttons - Elgato Streamdeck Plugin

This is a plugin for the Elgato Streamdeck enabling users to setup repeatable predictions and control them at their finger tips.

## How it works

Using TwitchCodeGenerator, users add an access code from the generator and can then setup predictions etc. When a prediction is initiated, the user is directed to a subview where they can directly control a prediction.

## Getting the app

You can access the (releases) [https://github.com/ScottMellors/io.predictionbuttons.sdPlugin/releases/] manually to download the plugin, or (when its available) on the Streamdeck store, allows updates to be downloaded automatically!

## Manually updating the app

At some point you may need to reinstall the app, if the new .streamDeckPlugin doesn't work, you will need to remove it from your plugins folder in **C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins** or for Mac Users **~/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/**. Just delete the *io.predictionbuttons.sdPlugin* and restart the app before updating.
