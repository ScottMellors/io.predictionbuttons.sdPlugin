# Twitch Chat Prediction Buttons - Elgato Streamdeck Plugin

This is a plugin for the Elgato Streamdeck enabling users to setup repeatable predictions and control them at their finger tips.

## How it works

Using TwitchCodeGenerator, users add an access code from the generator and can then setup predictions etc. When a prediction is initiated, the user is directed to a subview where they can directly control a prediction.

## To Do List

- Device profiles for mobile, XL and mini.
- Translations
- Better art
- Countdown indicator

## How can you help?

Got one of the devices listed above? We need profiles for those devices to switch to, may cause issues initially. You can do this by creating a new profile, adding the prediction buttons in a layout similar to this layout:![Elgato Streamdeck App showing a grid with the buttons laid out](https://i.imgur.com/RmmYWpV.png) Back button, cancel prediction button, lock button on one row, followed by outcomes 1 and 2 buttons below. Then exporting the profile, naming it appropriately and submitting a pull request on here.
