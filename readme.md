# Twitch Chat Prediction Buttons - Elgato Streamdeck Plugin

This is a plugin for the Elgato Streamdeck enabling users to setup repeatable predictions and control them at their finger tips.

## How it works

Get started by using the auth section in the start prediction action. This system will save those values locally, and then use them, reauthorise them when they expire and handle it all for you.

## Getting the app

You can access the [releases](https://github.com/ScottMellors/io.predictionbuttons.sdPlugin/releases/) manually to download the plugin, or (when its available) on the Streamdeck store, allows updates to be downloaded automatically!

## Manually updating the app

At some point you may need to reinstall the app, if the new .streamDeckPlugin doesn't work, you will need to remove it from your plugins folder in **C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins** or for Mac Users **~/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/**. Just delete the *io.predictionbuttons.sdPlugin* and restart the app before updating.
