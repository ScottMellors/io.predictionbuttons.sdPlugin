Howdy! I am GhostlyTuna, maker of apps for Live Streaming. I have just launched a new tool on the Elgato Streamdeck store to allow repeatable Twitch chat predictions that can be controlled from your fingertips.

[Elgato Streamdeck Store link](https://apps.elgato.com/plugins/io.predictionbuttons)

# Key Features

- Hassle free control of predictions from your stream deck
- Setup multiple predictions ready to execute whenever
- A dynamic control menu, no need to clutter up your main profile (unless you want to).

# Quick Setup guide

1. Add the app from the store!
2. Drag the ‘start prediction’ button onto a profile.
3. In the settings, add the auth token and hit the “Check Auth” button.
4. Green light! You're ready to go, press the buttons and predict away!
